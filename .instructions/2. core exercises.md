## Workshop exercises

### Core exercise

The following exercises will help you get started with GitHub Copilot. You must have completed the [setup instructions](<./1. setup.md>) before starting these steps.


### Step by step instructions

<details>
<summary>1. Getting the application running</summary>

**Starting Point**: You should have the repo open in VSCode (or your supported IDE)

1. Press ```CTRL + ` ``` to open the terminal window in VS Code if it is not already open.

2. Enter ```npm install``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to install the required dependencies. TIP: Ignore any issues displayed after you run this command.

Let's start by running the application to learn what it does.

3. Enter ```npm start``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to run the application.

4. In the pop-up window that appears in the bottom right corner of the Codespace window, click the **Open in Browser** button. This will securely map port 3000 from the Codespace environment (if you're using Codespaces) to your local browser so you can see the running calculator application.

5. Do some simple calculations to show that the calculator is working as expected.

6. Close the browser window for now and return to the Codespace window.

7. Ensure your focus is in the terminal window and press ``` CTRL + C ``` to stop the application.

<summary>2. Adding features using GitHub Copilot</summary>

**TO DO** -  You've been asked to add a new feature to the calculator application.

### Adding the power function to the backend

1. Open the `api/controller.js` file in the editor window.
2. Locate the `operations` object.
3. Add a new property to the `operations` object for the power operation. Use the key `'power'` and for the value, use a function that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns `Math.pow(a, b)`.

### Adding the buttons to the calculator UI

1. Open the `public/index.html` file in the editor window.
2. Scroll down to where you see the calculator buttons.
3. Add a new button for the power operation. Use the class `"btn"` for styling, set the `onClick` attribute to call `operationPressed('^')`, and use `^` as the button text.

### Adding the logic for the new features

1. Open the `public/client.js` file in the editor window.
2. Locate the `calculate` function.
3. Add a case for the power operation in the switch statement. When the operation is `'^'`, set the URI to include `"?operation=power"`.

4. Press ```CTRL + ` ``` to open the terminal window in VS Code.
5. Enter ```npm start``` in the terminal window and press **ENTER** to run the application.
6. You should test the new button by clicking 3, then the "^" (power) button, then click 2. Click "=" and the result should be 9.
7. Close the browser window, return to the Terminal window in Codespaces and press ```CTRL+C``` to terminate the application.

**Success**, you have enhanced the calculator application using GitHub Copilot!

>Hopefully your calculator is working! Remember, GitHub Copilot is probabilistic so you may not get the exact same code suggestions as we did. If you're not happy with the suggestions, you can always press **CTRL + Z** to undo the changes and try again.


#### What's next?
You're now ready to start the [challenge exercises](<./3. challenge exercises.md>) to see how you can leverage the power of GitHub Copilot to solve a number of challenges yourself.
